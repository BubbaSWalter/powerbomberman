Power Bomberman 0.7.7c Server
2022 JEI

All you need to do to set it up is to unblock your chosen TCP port and run it.
Config file will be generated by the program when you first open it. You can tweak that too.
The server has been written in C#. You can run it under Linux using Mono.
Native build will come someday.

CONFIG HELP:
name - the name of the server to be displayed in the game. Don't make this too long so it fits in the border.
port - TCP port to use.
maxClients - how many players can be connected to the server at once. Any further connection attempts at the full capacity will be rejected until somebody quits.
maxRooms - how many rooms can be created at once.
latencyMode - adjusts the frequency of game packet transmission. Available options are low, medium and high. low is preferred for the best experience, but you might want to try the others if you're having connection issues.
